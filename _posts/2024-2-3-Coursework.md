One course I had previously taken at Bellevue College was [CS209](http://catalog.bellevuecollege.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=12&coid=49855&){:target="_blank"} taught by prof. Serce. 

Before the class I only knew how to code in C and little bits of Python, and the class taught me basic Java from the ground up. It also showed a little on how to use debuggers and how useful they can be.
