    <h2>About me </h2>

    <p>
        Hi! My name is Yan, I am currently a running start student at Bellevue College and I hope to major in Computer Science.
    </p>

    <p>
        This website mainly serves as a portfolio and collection of things that I make or enjoy doing. This was made as a midterm project
        for my intro to web development and I hope to continue to add to it and use it :)
    </p>

    <p>
        Some goals that I have for the near future would be to learn more backend, and more C and C++ as those are my favorite languages.
        I guess I would also like to continue to learn web development and JS including other frameworks that friends use such as react and node.
    </p>
